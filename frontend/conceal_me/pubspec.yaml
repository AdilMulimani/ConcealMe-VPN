# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:

  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  assets:
   [.env,
#    assets/images/2k_earth-day.jpg,
#    assets/images/2k_stars.jpg,
#    assets/images/acknowledge.png,
#    assets/images/apple.svg,
#    assets/images/facebook.svg,
#    assets/images/google.svg,
#    assets/images/lock.png,
#    assets/images/shield.png,
#    assets/images/success_image.png
   ]


  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Outfit
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Outfit-Black.ttf
          weight: 900
        - asset: assets/fonts/Outfit-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/Outfit-ExtraBold.ttf
          weight: 800
        - asset: assets/fonts/Outfit-ExtraLight.ttf
          weight: 200
        - asset: assets/fonts/Outfit-Light.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: assets/fonts/Outfit-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/Outfit-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/Outfit-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: assets/fonts/Outfit-Thin.ttf
          weight: 100
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
